 *******************************************************************************
 * 
 * CbusLibXC8 and CbusLibBootXC8 is code that can form the basis of the firmware
 * required to build a Model Electronic Railway Group (MERG) CBUS compatible
 * module.  It was developed using the Microchip XC8 compiler and MPLAB X IDE,
 * and targets PIC18F MCUs with built-in CAN bus peripherals.
 * 
 * The software was created to meet the CBUS specification as detailed in the
 * "Developer's Guide for CBUS" version 6c.
 * 
 * Credit to Mike Bolton and Gil Fuchs for the development of CBUS, and to
 * Pete Brownlow, Ian Hogg, and many other MERG members, for the development
 * and testing of CBUS modules, hardware and firmware, over the past 15 years.
