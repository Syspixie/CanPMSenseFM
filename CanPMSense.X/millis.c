 * CbusLibXC8 and CbusLibBootXC8 is code that can form the basis of the firmware
 * required to build a Model Electronic Railway Group (MERG) CBUS compatible
 * module.  It was developed using the Microchip XC8 compiler and MPLAB X IDE,
 * and targets PIC18F MCUs with built-in CAN bus peripherals.
 * 
 * The software was created to meet the CBUS specification as detailed in the
 * "Developer's Guide for CBUS" version 6c.
 * 
 * Credit to Mike Bolton and Gil Fuchs for the development of CBUS, and to
 * Pete Brownlow, Ian Hogg, and many other MERG members, for the development
 * and testing of CBUS modules, hardware and firmware, over the past 15 years.

/**
 * Code to provide a general-purpose one millisecond timer/counter.
 * 
 * @author Konrad Orlowski
 * @date August 2022
 * 
 * @note Uses hardware TIMER0 module.
 * 
 * Provides 'normal' 32-bit timer/counter, with an overrun period of 49.7 days.
 * By using only the lower word of the same variable, we have a 16-bit
 * timer/counter with an overrun period of 65 seconds - perfectly adequate for
 * timing events in the order of a few hundred milliseconds.
 * 
 * The millisTicks counter should not, ordinarily, be accessed directly, but by
 * the getMillis and getMillisShort functions, which ensure that the value
 * returned has not been incremented during the multi-byte read operation
 * (without disabling interrupts).
 * 
 * However, as the increment only occurs during an interrupt, code running as
 * part of an interrupt service routine, or with interrupts otherwise disabled,
 * can safely access millisTicks or millisTicks.word[0].  If separate low and
 * high priority interrupts are enabled, then this applies ONLY to interrupts
 * at the SAME priority as the millis interrupt.
